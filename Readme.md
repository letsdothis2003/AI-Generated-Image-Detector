# Haven't thought of a creative name for this yet!

During covid, I got interested into deepfakes or images manipulated by artificial intelligence as they looked uncanny. Around fall of 2025, this interest got further developed as I learned more about digital image processing and also
other security issues regarding ai-generated content.

## Overview

This project explores how machine learning models learn to interpret images. The goal is to build a system that can detect and classify different types of visual data.
So far, we used HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients) Features, PCA(Principal Component Analysis) , and SVM(Support Vector Machine).

##  Phase 1 — Face Detection  

### Objectives
- Detect faces in static images  
- Explore real-time detection via webcam  
- Compare different model architectures  
- Build a unified interface supporting both digit and face detection
-You know how Ai for some reason gives weird skin textures cause it can't create realistic lighting or skin, this is just that.



## FUTURE PLANS 
## — Digit and letter Recognition(In Progress)


Using an MNIST dataset, we would like to combat Google's ai for generating handwriting. 

### Objectives
- Preprocess and normalize image data  
- Train a neural network to classify digits  
- Evaluate accuracy and performance until its like 90-ish percent. 


  




### Objectives
- Use a non-Ai picture to assess an Ai generated one. 
- Detects if it looks weird or uncanny.
